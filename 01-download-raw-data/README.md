## Rules of a card game

As raw text data, I use the rules of a card game, Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game created by Richard Garfield, released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast.

The reference "Comprehensive Rules" can be downloaded at [https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules](https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules).

For beginners, there is an introductory "Rulebook" available in French: [https://magic.wizards.com/fr/rules](https://magic.wizards.com/fr/rules)
